# Changes

- make errors include positions (TokenError, ASTError, etc.)
- `closed` type definitions
- remove `->` operator, just use `.` for everything (inc. methods), update `?->` to `?.` accordingly
- overload `?.` for interfaces
- split up loops into two categories: `for` and `loop`
  - `loop` is for infinite and conditional loops `loop (expr) { ... }`
    and `loop { }` for infinite loops
  - `for` is for iterative for loops (c-style, iterators)
- change expression local syntax to `x := value in expr`
- remove `then`
- remove necessity of `new` keyword (can keep `make` syntax tho)
- remove constructors (can be implemented as `NewType()` methods if really necessary)
- make init lists main way to initialize structured types
  - don't have to provide values for everything
- constancy only applies to references and variables (mutable, named values)
  - for variable declarators:
    - `const x ...`
    - constancy will be applied as an optimization after semantic checking
      where possible
  - same syntax for structs and function arguments
  - for references:
    - `&const x` (create a const reference to x)
    - `const dyn* x` (constant dynamic reference)
    - `const* x` (const stack reference)
    - `const vol* x` (constant volatile reference)
  - reference constancy is viral
    - `let x = &const y;` (x is now a const reference)
    - x can still be mutated, the reference cannot be
  - value constancy is not
    - `const x = 10; let y = x;` (y is not constant)
  - casting rules: mutable -> constant, constant -/> mutable
  - methods can be constant (explicitly)
- cannot take a non-const reference to a constant value
- remove `static`
- value categories
  - lvalue (well-defined, mutable value, able to take both kinds of references to it)
  - cvalue (well-defined, immutable value, only able to take a const reference to it, value constancy)
  - rvalue (undefined, immutable value, unable to take any kind of reference to it)
- partial function calling (replacement for old partial function syntax)
  - `f(_, 23, _)` creates a function from f that accepts the two arguments left blank
  - can allow for "currying" (not actually but...)
  - more clear than implicit currying/argument omission (re. Haskell)
- memory model
  - three kinds of pointers: stack, dynamic, volatile
  - stack pointers have standard stack lifetimes unconditionally
  - dynamic pointers have compiled-determined and/or user-specified lifetimes
  - lifetimes can be conditional (eg. one branch of if returns value, other deletes it)
  - if the compiler cannot determine the lifetime of the resource, then error
  - if the use of a resource is inconsistent with its specified lifetime, then error
  - `delete` statement used to ensure resource has a proper lifetime
    - delete must not violate an established lifetime
    - used when the compiler thinks a resource may not be able to user-managed (see examples)
  - `always` statement used to "prove" that a loop or conditional branch always occurs
    - like a promise to the compiler
    - can cause the compiler to identify and error on deadcode
  - `own` keyword used in certain contexts to indicate that a value's lifetime is bound to its current scope
    - eg. function arguments
  - all dynamic allocations in any particular scope must have an "owner"
    - eg. if a function returns a dynamic value, but that value is not stored anywhere that is an error
  - use of move operator (`:>`) for efficient dynamic assignment (and deletion)
    - similar semantics to delete operator
  - all lifetimes are compiler-managed on a resource level (not name level)
    - eg. you can assign to a resource's owner without a move call (bad practice) without necessarily violating
    the lifetime b/c the compiler simply caches that resource if its lifetime needs to be enforced
    - may be a problem if the compiler determines that that resource has an inconsistent lifetime as a result
  - null pointer errors handled in two ways
    - regular dereference operators on both known kinds of pointers have checks that cause runtime panics
    if null pointer is encountered
    - nullable dereference operators have same behavior as regular but return null instead of panicing
  - assignment is only valid in certain situations:
    - it doesn't cause a lifetime violation (see docs)
    - it doesn't lead to an inconsistent or indeterminate lifetime
  - move is valid everywhere delete is valid and:
    - when deletion would cause an indeterminate lifetime (see example at end of docs)
    - ie. it is only valid on direct resource holders (where the lifetime is predetermined)
  - lifetimes operate in terms of proofs (so while some items are general rules, the nuances of the lifetime proof
  may actually lead to their violation)
    - compiler has to prove that the lifetime of the resource can be made equal to the lifetime of the resource
    holder
    - moreover, it has to prove that every resource a resource holder stores is consistent in this way
    - there are certain situations in which the lifetime can actually be unequal to that of the holder
  - see examples in docs
- move operator overloads outside of interfaces
  - allows for more efficient overloads (defined in terms of functions, makes more sense)
  - operators can be "left-handed" or "right-handed"
  - logically, an operator doesn't have a "primary operand" (when we see `2 + 3`, we don't think `2.add(3)`)
- builtin support for vectorization
  - vector constructor: `<value : const_len>` or `<{elems...}>`
  - vector data type: `<size>type` (only valid on integral, floating point or pointer types)
  - vector generics: `<T, in N>` (N is a size parameter to a vector data type)
  - all basic arithmetic operations are valid on vectors (scalar and vector mult)
  - additional intrinsics and utilities (eg. `__vec_sum(v)` and `__shuffle_vec(v1, v2, mask)`)
  - `#vec_unroll` annotation to cause vector functions to be optimized (as much as possible)
  - extended (later) as part of math library (intended for general purpose use, also used in matrices and complex numbers)
  - vector array initializers should be compiled as `shufflevector` if possible
  - VECTORS ARE ITERABLE
- intrinsic implementation
  - prevent intrinsics from being converted to first class functions
  - allow for generic intrinsics
  - `#intrinsic` annotation (implementation)
- inline method calls (as much as possible - may only be possible in type interfaces)
- remove group overloading (it just seems awkward - leads to duplication and ambiguity)
- allow pass by reference arguments (for ease of use of collections)
  - avoids us having to implement reference semantics on collections for usability
  - only used function arguments so not ambiguous
  - trims down on unnecessary pointers and dereferences (use of pointers where pointers make no sense)
  - makes code more readable
