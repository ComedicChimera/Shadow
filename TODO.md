# TODO

- add get struct (for default types)
- add prelude (later)
- add 3 sanitizers (const, constexpr, and memory) [Note: constexpr does in depth checking on all constant expressions]
- allow primitives to implement interfaces (have duck typing)

# THOUGHTS

- add positioning data to some or all of the action tree (maybe identifiers?)
- allow interfaces and agents to have variance
- agent id methods

# FUTURE

- add operator overloading during generation

# TESTING

- after clause (except clause)
- static get
- reference types
- new syntax
- templates
- variants
- interfaces
- types
- agents
- object level method variance
- recursive type definition
- is operator
- exception ending
- EVERYTHING
