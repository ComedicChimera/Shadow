# TODO
add function references
change unsigned to uprefix (uint, ufloat, ulong, ect.)
add scope first top level symbol declaration
add null keyword
allow for recursive type definition
allow for object level method variance
add after clause (context manager, loops, except blocks)
change "private" to "priv"
add function decorators
remove partiality (and all associated constructs)
remove static function members and static type members
remove multiple constructors and constructor keyword (in favor of single __init__ method)

# THOUGHTS
change type checking to allow for multitype bitwise operations

# FUTURE
add operator overloading in reduction stage
add 3 analyzers (const, thread, and memory)
