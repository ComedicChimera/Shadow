# TODO

- add scope first top level symbol declaration
- add null keyword
- allow for recursive type definition
- allow for object level method variance
- add after clause (context manager, loops, except blocks)
- add visiting for types, templates, and variants
- add agents (agent syntax, agent event model)
- replace enum const with pure enum

# THOUGHTS

- add positioning data to some or all of the action tree
- add in the `auto` keyword for explicit inferred data type (in certain situations)
- add in some support for monadic / dynamic types (Option, Never, ...); value based types (possibly extension of enum)

# FUTURE

- add operator overloading in reduction stage
- add 4 analyzers (const, constexpr, thread, and memory) [Note: constexpr does in depth checking on all constant expressions]
