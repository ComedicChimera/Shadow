# TODO

- add scope first top level symbol declaration
- allow for recursive type definition
- allow for object level method variance
- add visiting for types, templates, and variants
- add agents (agent syntax, agent event model)
- remove $ operator in favor of let keyword, revise partial function to use _ instead of $
- remove @ operator in favor of const keyword
- add in the `auto` keyword for explicit inferred data type (in certain situations)
- add inline case block
- remove from borrow syntax (and explicit borrowing completely)

# THOUGHTS

- add positioning data to some or all of the action tree

# FUTURE

- add operator overloading in reduction stage
- add 4 analyzers (const, constexpr, thread, and memory) [Note: constexpr does in depth checking on all constant expressions]

# TESTING

- after clause (except clause)
- static get
- reference types
