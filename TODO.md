# TODO

- add conditional event handlers for agents `when(x: type => condition)`

# THOUGHTS

- add positioning data to some or all of the action tree
- allow interfaces to have variance

# FUTURE

- add operator overloading in reduction stage
- add 4 analyzers (const, constexpr, thread, and memory) [Note: constexpr does in depth checking on all constant expressions]

# TESTING

- after clause (except clause)
- static get
- reference types
- new syntax
- templates
- variants
- interfaces
- types
- agents
- object level method variance
- recursive type definition
- EVERYTHING
