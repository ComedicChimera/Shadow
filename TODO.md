# TODO

- **OVERRIDE** Implement `changes.md`
- add get struct (for default types) - deprecated
- add prelude (later)
- add 3 sanitizers (const, constexpr, and memory) [Note: constexpr does in depth checking on all constant expressions]
- allow primitives to implement interfaces (have duck typing) - deprecated
- add template overloads 
- prevent declaration of null type lists
- remove MirrorType and declare builtins in SymbolTable as necessary
- allow for incomplete type declaration of type classes (and other higher order types) - deprecated
- review ownership rules for deletion of values - deprecated

# THOUGHTS

- add positioning data to some or all of the action tree (maybe identifiers?)
- allow interfaces and agents to have variance
- agent id methods
- make sure to properly name arg and parameter videos

# FUTURE

- add operator overloading during generation

# TESTING

- after clause (except clause)
- static get
- reference types
- new syntax
- templates
- variants
- interfaces
- types
- agents
- object level method variance
- recursive type definition
- is operator
- exception ending
- EVERYTHING
