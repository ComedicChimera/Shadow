# Notes

List of things that were on the Desktop Note that are no longer relevant after
the "removal" of the memory model and the commitment to a GC.

- List and dictionary region specifiers
- Consider: Make arrays stack only (use block references for heap arrays)
- Consider: Make lists and dictionaries named data types (not "builtins")
- Ensure reference slices aren't invalidated on resize
