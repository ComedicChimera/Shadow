It is strongly-typed, object-oriented, expressive, concurrent, and relatively easy to learn.
It boasts numerous new and old features and is designed to represent the needs of any software developer.

## Author's Note
This compiler is the realization of my vision as a programmer. I have been obsessed with languages
and language design pretty much since the first day I picked up programming. I hope that this language
can be as amazing to you as it is to me. I am always happy to have people who want to make
suggestions and contributions to help make this language as great as it can be.

By the time it is finished, this language will likely be the culminations of thousands of hours of work
and I sincerely believe it will be worth it.
