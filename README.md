# Whirlwind

Whirlwind is a compiled, modern, and multipurpose language designed with intentionality.
It is strongly-typed, object-oriented, expressive, concurrent, and relatively easy to learn.
It boasts numerous new and old features and is designed to represent the needs of any software developer.

### Goals:

Whirlwind has several main goals all of which can be enscapsulated in the idea of speed.

 * Speed of writing.
 * Speed of thinking.
 * Speed of compiling.
 * Speed of running.
 
Whirlwind tries to achieve all of these goals, and admittedly falls short in some areas.  When using more high level constructs,
there is often a trade off between ease of thought and writing, and speed of compilation and execution.  When designing this
language I aimed for an "85% solution" which effectively means close enough, but not perfect: each construct fulfills the majority of our speed goals, but not all at once.  In essence, instead of trying to make each and every construct perfect, I provide a variety of constructs and approaches each of which is suited to one of the goals, this design allowing you to choose what you find most important.

## Author's Note
This compiler is the realization of my vision as a programmer. I have been obsessed with languages
and language design pretty much since the first day I picked up programming. I hope that this language
can be as amazing to you as it is to me. I am always happy to have people who want to make
suggestions and contributions to help make this language as great as it can be.

By the time it is finished, this language will likely be the culminations of thousands of hours of work
and I sincerely believe it will be worth it.
